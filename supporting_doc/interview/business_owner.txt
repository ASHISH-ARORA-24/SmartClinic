Interview Transcript – Notes for You
EA (You/Me): Dr. Mehta, thanks for meeting. Can you share what triggered this EA engagement?

Dr. Mehta (Business Owner):
    Of course. We currently run 3 clinics across two cities. Each uses its own system — Excel sheets, paper, emails. It’s chaos. We’re overwhelmed with duplicate data, delays in billing, and no visibility into doctor schedules or patient records.

EA: What are the top problems you're trying to solve?

Dr. Mehta:
    Digitize patient records across all clinics
    Centralize doctor scheduling
    Improve billing efficiency
    Launch a mobile app for patients
    Provide insights into clinic operations

EA: Understood. What's your broader vision for SmartClinic?

Dr. Mehta:
    A digital-first chain of clinics where patients book, consult, and get reports via a single platform. We want to grow from 3 to 10 clinics in 2 years.

EA: Are there any known constraints?
Dr. Mehta:
    Budget is fixed for Phase 1: ₹15 lakhs
    Limited tech staff (just 1 internal IT manager)
    No cloud infrastructure today
    We can’t disrupt live clinic operations

EA: Who are the key stakeholders we should involve?

Dr. Mehta:
    Myself and Dr. Rekha (Co-founder, handles operations)
    IT Manager (Nikhil)
    Finance Lead (Nazia)
    Marketing Head (Anup, who will drive mobile app adoption)
    Patient rep (selected regular patient, Ravi)
